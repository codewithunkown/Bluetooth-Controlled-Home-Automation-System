UART Based Bluetooth-Controlled Home Automation System

Using Bluetooth Uart serial terminal able to control home appliances

Key Skills: UART Protocol, Bluetooth Interfacing            
Platform: Nï»¿XP LPC2129 Microcontroller


Abstract:
This project showcases a Bluetooth-enabled home automation system using UART Protocol and 
an NXP LPC2129 Microcontroller. By interfacing with an HC-05 Bluetooth module, users can 
remotely control lights and fans via a smartphone app. The system employs triacs and optocouplers for AC device control, prioritizing safety and efficiency. 
LED indicators provide real-time feedback on appliance status, ensuring seamless user interaction.
